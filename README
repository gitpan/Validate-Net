NAME
    Validate::Net - Format validation and more for Net:: related strings

SYNOPSIS
      use Validate::Net;
  
      my $good = '123.1.23.123';
      my $bad = '123.432.21.12';
  
      foreach ( $good, $bad ) {
            if ( Validate::Net->ip( $_ ) ) {
                    print "'$_' is a valid ip\n";
            } else {
                    print "'$_' is not a valid ip address because:\n";
                    print Validate::Net->reason . "\n";
            }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Validate::Net is a class designed to assist with validation internet
    related strings. It can be used to validate CGI forms, internally by
    modules, and in any place where you want to check that an internet
    related string is valid before handing it off to a Net::* class.

    Whenever a test is false, you can access the reason through the "reason"
    method.

METHODS
  ip( $ip, @options )
    The "ip" method is used to validate the format, and more, of an ip
    address. If called with no options, it will just do a basic format check
    of the ip, checking that it conforms to the basic dotted quad format.
    Depending on the options, additional checks may be made.

    There are no options available at this time.
